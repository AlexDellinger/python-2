"""A Time Paradox

    Over the ages of time there have been many great events that have changed our world. These acomplishments have
plunged the human race further and further into advancements in technology, discovery, and knowledge. But humans 
can be selfish. Men and Women in the future have use of time machines and use them to create paradox's. These 
paradox's are making the human race less advanced in technology, speech, discovery, and knowledge. some people believe
the world is flat. Others think it is eight times the size it really is. And some people think it is owned by the roman
and greek gods. 
    
    You however, are unaffected by this. You had started to forget, but you are a highly inteligent person, 
who knows how dangerous paradox's can be. You have written a document telling you what the world is like today.
you now remember what the world is like. You know that this change in humans is caused by silly choices in the 
future and you must go and undo them. You must build a time machine and go through the ages undoing all that has been
done. 

    You at least know three of the times that the people came: The Medevial Times, Ancient Egypt, and finally, the 
US in the 1800's. You must go through many more time periods than this however. You even might have to travel to 
different worlds and dimensions. If you fail your mission, The human race as we know it could fade away... forever.
If you succeed in your mission the human race would be able to evolve and be smarter than they ever were. However the 
jealous people in the future have placed robots in the times they went to and changed to make sure no one can undo 
them and they can remain legend when they die. This journey will be perilous, but you have a secret protecter you 
do not know of...
